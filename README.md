At The App Business we believe that writing clean, clear, and consistent code forms the foundations of every great app
we build. One of the ways we stay on top of this is with our coding standards and style guides. We've published ours to
GitHub so we can quickly iterate on them, and to give others an insight into how we work.

All you need to apply this and other best practices to your project is available in an easy-to-use gem, included in this
repository.

Static analysis is key to enhancing our agility and ability to deliver the very best. We use it for everything from
known security vulnerabilities to code complexity. Our philosophy is it should be easier to do the right thing than not.

Our Ruby coding standards:
* [The description](DESCRIPTION.md)
* [The gem](/GEM.md)

You can find all the style guides from our other engineering teams [here](https://github.com/theappbusiness?utf8=âœ“&query=guide).
